    "I find the business problem, locate the AI opportunity, and ship the system end to end: architecture, APIs, front end, back end. Most of what I've built lately has AI inside it. The part I care about is making it reliable enough to hand to real users.",

  about: [
    "I'm a senior at Arizona State studying computer science. Most of what I know about building software I learned by shipping things other people then had to rely on.",
    "This summer at Avis Budget Group I took four initiatives from a blank architecture diagram to production handoff — a multilingual retrieval service, an internal assistant, a natural-language analytics engine, and a delivery automation. I owned the system design, the API surface, and both ends of the stack. I presented the designs to a Director and a VP, and demoed the platform to the CEO.",
    "The part I care about most is the unglamorous half: writing the test suite before trusting the output, checking a schema against real production data instead of mocks, and deciding what a system should refuse to do. That's usually where the difference between a demo and a product lives.",
