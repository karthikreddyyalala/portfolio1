    tagline: "A multi-stage interview agent that rewrites the next session around where you struggled last time.",
    body: "A LangGraph pipeline across six stages (intake, planning, live interview, evaluation, cross-session memory, coaching) where each session's question plan is rewritten around the candidate's persisted weak spots. Verified by end-to-end tests that assert on actual generated prompt text, proving real adaptation rather than schema conformance. Golden-dataset eval harness covers adversarial cases: buzzword-padded answers, length-bias traps, subtly wrong Big-O buried in fluent prose. Claude Haiku handles structured extraction; Sonnet handles reasoning. A concurrent-write data-loss bug in cross-session memory was caught and fixed via optimistic locking with conditional writes. Full serverless stack with 100+ backend tests and CI.",

Built with retry logic, exponential backoff, and output caching so a single failed tool call does not sink an entire run. Cut manual research effort by 70%.",
